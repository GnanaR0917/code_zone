        <p>Swiggy is an Indian online food ordering and delivery company.
         Founded in 2014, Swiggy is headquartered in Bangalore and operates in more than 580 Indian cities, as of July 2023.
         Besides food delivery, the platform also provides quick commerce services under the name Swiggy Instamart, and same-day package deliveries with Swiggy Genie.
        It rivals homegrown startup Zomato in food delivery and hyperlocal marketplace.
         In 2011, Sriharsha Majety and Nandan Reddy designed an e-commerce website called Bundl to facilitate courier service and shipping within India.
        Bundl was halted in 2014 and rebranded to enter the food delivery market.[7] Majety and Reddy approached Rahul Jaimini, formerly with Myntra, and founded Swiggy in August 2014.</p>
